1. Research Question

Is there a significant relationship between GDP per capita and women’s tertiary education attainment rates in OECD countries?

2. Motivation

Understanding the interplay between economic prosperity and educational attainment is crucial for policymakers aiming to promote sustainable development and gender equality. In many OECD countries, women have surpassed men in tertiary education attainment, with 52% of 25-34-year-old women holding tertiary qualifications compared to 39% of men.  Investigating how GDP per capita influences these educational trends can provide insights into the effectiveness of economic policies and investments in education.(oecd.org)
